From March 2016 to June 2016


A lightstage is a device which allows, thanks to a set of prepositionned cameras and a lighting system, 
to obtain a 3D model of an object or a person, using 3D reconstructions algorithms. 
This can produce extremly detailed models. This process was already used in VFX in some [Blockbusters](http://gl.ict.usc.edu/LightStages/).
This project was realized during an internship of 3 months in the [Aberystwyth University](https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/) labs in Wales. I was supervised by [Hannah Dee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannah_Dee).
I am in charge of the programmation of arduinos for the lighting system, and also research on the best 
positions of the lights to have an homogeneous lighting of the model in the device.
