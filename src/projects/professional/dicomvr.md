In collaboration with the laboratory of Christophe Lohou, we have to implement a 3D interactive application using Unity
to visualize and interact with datas from medical imaging.
It allows you to read DICOM files and render it in 3D, and then use segmentation algorithm.
This application is an alternative to the already existant solutions(MITK,
Slicer etc...) which don't necessarily offer the same features we want to implement, and in a non intuitive way.
This project was shown at the [RITS 2017](https://rits2017.sciencesconf.org/) Conference in Lyon(France)
