From March 2019 to September 2019


End of study internship in [Allegorithmic](https://www.substance3d.com/) company, I work with the Substance Alchemist team in Lyon.

A substance material is a procedurally generated material, generating textures designed to be integrated in a PBR 
(physically based rendering) rendering software.
The advantage of being procedural is that you can tweak parameters in the material creation process and some are exposed to 
the user, configuring it's own variation of the material.


I work on material analysis based on PBR material maps (base color, normal, roughness, ...) 
But also implement the work in the already existing software [Substance Alchemist](https://www.substance3d.com/products/substance-alchemist).
