From October 2019 until now


[SurgAR](http://www.surgar-surgery.com/) (Surgical Augmented Reality) is a startup whose objective is the development and marketing of augmented reality (AR) software for laparoscopic surgery. 
The surgical procedure will become safer and for the patient, the surgeon and the health care structure as a whole.


My mission there is to work on the rendering, the team did not have any employee with solid graphics API knowledge. So I am in charge of the development of the graphics engine. I also contribute in the 3D data processing part, 
implying geometry and computational geometry (boolean operation, mesh editing, ...).
