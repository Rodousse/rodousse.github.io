After watching [Keenan Crane](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/) excellent video series on [computer graphics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9_jI1bdZmz2emSh0UQ5iOdT2xRHFHL7E), I decided to try to develop a really quick quad light illumination shader in [ShaderToy](https://www.shadertoy.com/).

This is a very basic illumination computing only the diffuse illumination using the ratio of the projected quad area over the hemisphere area. Basic, but efficient.

See the shader in action [here](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/fsc3WM).
