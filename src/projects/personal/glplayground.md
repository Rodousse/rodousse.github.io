This repo is my playground when I want to discover new OpenGL/rendering/geometry processing features.
In a way it's more a collection of small projects from tesselation to UBO.

Libs used:
- [Assimp](https://github.com/assimp/assimp): Used to load model files to render 
- [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page): Matrice and vector manipulation
- [Stbipp](https://github.com/Rodousse/stbipp): Image I/O
- [glfw](https://github.com/glfw/glfw.git): Window and context provider
- [Flix01/imgui](https://github.com/Flix01/imgui.git): Imgui fork with an additionnal file browser 
- [glew](https://github.com/nigels-com/glew): OpenGL extension wrangler
- [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog.git): Log system
