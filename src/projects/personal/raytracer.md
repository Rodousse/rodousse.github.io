Took a week of vacation and finally found the time to implement a raytracer that is actually working. So starting from scratch I applied my recent knowledge to make it work. 

After an interesting result, took the opportunity to buy the holy global illumination bible : [PBRT](https://pbrt.org/). I will probably enhance this project after reading this.

You can find this project on [Github](https://github.com/Rodousse/raytracing-discovery).
