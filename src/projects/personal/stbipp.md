Just a lib I made when I was trying to get a small sized library for image loading/saving, and also being able to edit the given image easily. 
As I love stb_image, I wrapped it in a new lib, It adds an abstract layer on top of stb. 
You can find this project on [Github](https://github.com/Rodousse/stbipp).
