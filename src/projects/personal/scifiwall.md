Scifi Wall Material creation using Substance Designer.
Because of my exams, I had not the chance to add my entry to the contest "Materialize"
organized by Allegorithmic.
You had to take a photo on their instagram profile [Mattershots](https://www.instagram.com/mattershots/) and synthetize a material
from it !
